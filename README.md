 Hello everyone,

I am offering individual or group online live training via Microsoft Teams for a comprehensive data analytics crash course priced at TZS 300,000. This intensive program will run for two weeks.

**Objective:** The aim of this course is to equip learners with practical skills to become competent data analytics experts in any field, including but not limited to business, healthcare, research, military, and scientific research.

**Important Notes:**

* No certificate will be issued upon completion of this course.
* Enrollment is based on a mutual agreement between you and the instructor.
* If you are already a data analytics professional and are solely interested in model deployment, please select the final package.
