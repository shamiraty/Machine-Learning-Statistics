Hello everyone,

I am offering an intensive **individual or group** online live training course via Microsoft Teams focused on data analytics. This comprehensive crash course is priced at TZS 300,000   and will be delivered over **two weeks each package**.

**Objective:** This course aims to equip learners with the *practical skills* necessary to become *competent data analytics experts* across various fields, including business, healthcare, research, the military, scientific research, and more.

**Important Notes:**

1.  Please note that a certificate will *not* be issued upon completion of this training.
2.  Enrollment in this course is based on a *mutual understanding and agreement* between you and the instructor.
3.  If you are already a data analytics professional and are primarily interested in learning about model deployment techniques, please consider selecting the final package.
